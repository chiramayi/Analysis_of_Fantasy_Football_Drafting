Analysis Of Fantasy Football 
By Chira Abdullgafoor

Motivation/Summery 

My aim in this project is to highlight the inefficiencies in the way positions are drafted in fantasy football. I gained most of my motivation from a lifetime of joy from playing fantasy football and new found perspective gained from the movie Money Ball. My theory at the start of this project revolved around a similar idea to Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics. That being instead of over valuing big name players in the draft process it might be more efficient to take a step back and draft by position for points. 

A great Illustration of use would be any incoming new player or a seasoned veteran looking for a competitive advantage. I’ve been on both sides of this spectrum and can tell you from experience that this data driven take on drafting is a breath of fresh air. Most drafting methods today are based on long standing superstitions  or based on professional opinion but at a certain point I firmly believe that a data driven perspective is needed to clarify what has happened in the past and to highlight what we need to do in the future. 

Extra Notes:

My perspective with this project was I wanted to use data that was easily available to the public. So that meant that I would only use information that was free to everyone and very easy to find.

I took this data and refined it to its purest form so I could have something simple to work with. I believe that even though creating something can be complicated as long as we the creators keep it simple for the public to use we can reach a wider audience overall.
